Interactive training for functional analysis and interpretation of disease data using computational modelling tools

# Summary

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is critical to monitor as it threatens modern medical and public health systems. The Clinically Oriented antimicrobial Resistance Network (ACORN) project is developing an effective AMR surveillance system across nine African and Asian countries. This page is a landing for training developed in collaboration with Wellcome Connecting Science. 

# Target Audience

This programme aims to train ACORN team members across nine centres with core bioinformatics skills which can be utilised to analyse and identify resistance from pathogen genome data.

## Learning outcomes
### WCS ACORN - Bioinformatics for Antimicrobial Resistance:
At the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Apply appropriate tools to analyse WGS data of bacterial genomes
- Identify sequencing data formats
- Use pathogen genomic analysis web-tools to process sequence data
- Execute the basic processes of genome assembly for pathogen species
- Identify and interrogate antibiotic resistance genes and mutations
- Implement data workflows and bioinformatic analysis of genomic sequence data, including risk and resistance prediction for bacterial epidemiology and pandemic response
- Conduct phylogenetic analysis in the context of outbreak and other epidemiological investigations
- Compare phylogenetic trees for different species and outbreak scenarios

# Programme

This virtual bioinformatics course will offer a series of lectures and practical sessions including the following topics:

- Pathogen genome assembly
- Annotation of pathogen genomes
- Phylogenetics in clinical contexts
