**Project summary:**
*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a big concern in disease control in clinical settings as it invovles in many nosocomial infections.
In this study, we collected samples (tissue, blood, urine) from inpatients in three hospitals (A, B and C) from 2019 to 2021. 
The `.csv` contains the metadata with Sequence Typing. 
The `.tree` file is the pre-built core genome maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.
